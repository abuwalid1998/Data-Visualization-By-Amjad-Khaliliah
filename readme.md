# Flight Performance Over Time
## by Amjad Khaliliah

## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The primary objective was to systematically explore a dataset using Python visualization libraries. The analysis begins with the examination of individual variables and progresses to bivariate and multivariate analyses.

To effectively communicate the key findings, a brief presentation was created utilizing exploratory data analysis. A slide deck was prepared that outlines the main exploration pathways and constructs a narrative to help readers understand the insights uncovered throughout the project.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project was selected from a list provided by Udacity. It consists of the Flights dataset, which reports flight performance metrics in the United States, covering data from 2006 to 2008. The data is sourced from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

## Summary of Findings

The analysis revealed that the primary causes of flight delays were related to carrier issues and weather conditions. Notably, American Airlines emerged as the worst-performing carrier, exhibiting the highest rates of delays and cancellations from 2006 to 2008. These findings are illustrated in the presentation through various graphs and charts.

## Key Insights for Presentation

The visualizations included in the presentation were carefully selected to enable a simultaneous examination of delays and cancellations, facilitating a comparative analysis. Carrier performance was assessed through both metrics, which are prominently featured and highlighted in the presentation.

## Technologies Used
